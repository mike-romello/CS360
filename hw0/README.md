Preferred name: Mike

Preferred pronouns: he/him

If there's a chance we might mispronounce your name, please tell us what the proper pronunciation is:

What are your biggest two concerns this term (neither has to involve CS 360!): That I don't have the required prior knowledge for my classes. Second, I'm worried CS283, CS360, CS380, MATH200, and MATH221 was a bad idea.

Put anything you would like us to know here: I took DSA at another college so I am probably really behind in knowledge there.
